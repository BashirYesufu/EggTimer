# Egg Timer

## Goal

This App will be a mix of tutorials and challenges. Most importantly, I want to get comfortable with looking up how to do something I've never done before. In certain places of this app, I’ll follow the techniques used in my Xylophone app and use Google search, StackOverflow and Apple Documentation to make my code do what I want it to. But there are also other parts where I’ll tackle new Swift programming concepts. 

## What I'll Make

I’ll be building a beautiful egg timer app to boil eggs to perfection depending on how a user prefers their eggs. 

## What you will learn

* Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
* The Swift Timer API
* Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
* Conditional statements - Switch
* Functions with outputs
* How to use the ProgressView
